# Lenny-Informed Planning

The user wants to plan: "$ARGUMENTS"

Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Gather Lenny's Podcast Insights

Based on what the user wants to build, identify 2-4 relevant topics from: growth, pricing, product-market-fit, roadmap, metrics, hiring, leadership, strategy, enterprise, consumer, ai, execution, culture, fundraising, design, analytics.

Use the `get_product_advice` tool to fetch insights for those topics.

## Step 2: Present the Insights

Before entering plan mode, present the insights clearly:

```
## Lenny's Podcast Insights for Your Plan

Based on your goal, here's relevant advice from product leaders:

### 1. [Insight title]
**Guest:** [Name] | **Episode:** [Episode name]
> "[Quote]"
**Takeaway:** [How this applies to their plan]

### 2. [Insight title]
...
```

Show 3-5 of the most relevant insights with clear attribution.

## Step 3: Enter Plan Mode

After presenting the insights, enter plan mode and create a plan that thoughtfully incorporates the advice. As you write the plan, reference which insights influenced specific decisions:

- "Following [Guest]'s advice on [topic], we'll..."
- "As [Guest] noted about [topic]..."

Make the connection between Lenny's advice and your plan explicit so the user can see how the insights shaped the approach.
